With markdown, you can make text **bold**, _italic_, or even ~~strikethrough~~.

According to [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), you can also:

> Quote text with a > in front of it

You can also create [links to websites](https://github.com/CS302spr23/hw-4-ctstewart) or [local files](./README.md). Here are some more ways markdown can be used:

-   Unordered lists
-   [x] Showcase task lists
-   [ ] Call my mom :joy:

1. Ordered lists
1. Inline code: `print("Like this!")`
1. Code blocks:

```java
System.out.println("I use this when I TA!");
```
